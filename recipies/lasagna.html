    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and
      <br />
      filling that it's worth it!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
      <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        <br />
        heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
        <br />
        paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1
        <br />
        teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer,
        <br />
        covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna <br />
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        <br />
        with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
        <br />
        remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a <br />
        9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
        <br />
        Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
        <br />
        mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over
        mozzarella,<br />
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with
        <br />
        remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
        <br />
        sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil
        <br />
        does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        <br />
        an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
        <br />

    </ol>
