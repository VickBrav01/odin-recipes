    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons chili oil (such as Mongolian Fire oil), divided</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir together 1 tablespoon chili oil, 2 tablespoon soy sauce, red pepper
        <br />
        flakes, and white pepper in a bowl. Add chicken pieces and mix with
        <br />
        marinade. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine remaining 1 tablespoon chili oil and soy sauce, mirin, garlic,
        <br />
        ginger, and salt in a small bowl; set sauce aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon cooking oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok over
        <br />
        medium high heat. Add seasoned chicken pieces and sliced shallots to the
        <br />
        hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, until the chicken is no longer pink
        <br />
        at the center and the liquid has started to evaporate, about 8 minutes.
        <br />
        Transfer to a bowl and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining tablespoon cooking oil in the same skillet over <br />
        medium-high heat. Add green beans to hot oil and cook, stirring <br />
        frequently, until beans turn bright green, about 1 minute. Add sauce and
        <br />
        stir to coat beans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return cooked chicken and shallots to the skillet and stir, about 3
        <br />
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together chicken base and water in a small bowl; stir in cornstarch
        <br />
        to make a slurry. Drizzle slurry into the skillet, stirring quickly.
        <br />
        Continue stirring and cooking until pan sauce is slightly thickened.
        <br />
        Serve garnished with sesame seeds.
      </li>
    </ol>
