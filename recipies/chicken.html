    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Greek chicken and potatoes is a classic. I don't have the energy or <br />
      courage to cater for a living but, if I did, this lemony dish would be one
      <br />
      of my go-to entrees, and not just for big, fat weddings. It's a proven
      <br />
      crowd-pleaser, simple to make, and easy on the wallet.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
      <li>3 russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>½ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil a large
        <br />
        roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken and potatoes in a large bowl. Add lemon juice, olive oil,
        <br />
        garlic, dried oregano, salt, rosemary, black pepper, and cayenne. Toss
        <br />
        until chicken and potatoes are evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken pieces skin-side up in the prepared pan. Tuck potato
        <br />
        pieces around chicken. Drizzle with 2/3 cup chicken broth. Spoon any
        <br />
        remaining marinade from the bowl over chicken and potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Toss chicken and potatoes,
        <br />
        then place chicken skin-side up again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue baking until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 25
        <br />
        minutes more; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should
        <br />
        register 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a serving platter and keep warm; leave potatoes in
        <br />
        the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on the broiler, or set oven to highest heat. Toss potatoes again to
        <br />
        coat in pan juices. Place the pan under the broiler and broil until
        <br />
        potatoes are crisped, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer potatoes to the platter with chicken.</li>
      <li>
        Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the <br />
        remaining 1/3 cup chicken broth and scrape up browned bits from the
        <br />
        bottom of the pan. Strain pan juices over chicken and potatoes. Sprinkle
        <br />
        with fresh oregano.
      </li>
    </ol>
